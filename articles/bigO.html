        <p> Is the language is a metric we use to describe the efficiency of algorithms. • An analogy Sending a hard drive to your friend, using an email, FTP, or some other means of electronic transfer. Some transfers take more than a day, so it would be
            faster to transfer it by plane across the country. • Time complexity: Asymptotic runtime or big 0 time the data transfer "algorithm". Time that the time to transfer the increases linearly with the size of the file. You can also have multiple
            variables in your runtime. • Big 0, Big Theta, and Big Omega: • Best case, worst case, and expected case: We can describe our runtime for an algorithm in three different ways. Quick sort picks a random element as a "pivot" and then swaps values
            in the array such that the elements less than pivot appear before elements greater than pivot. It recursively sorts the left and right sides using a similar process. Best case traverse the array once. Worst case the value is the biggest element
            in the array can happen if the pivot is set to be the first element in the subarray and the array is sorted in reverse. In this case, out recursion doesn’t divide the array in half and recurse n each half. It shrinks the subarray by one element.
            The best case and the expected case are the same. We need to describe both of the runtimes. Big0/theta describes the time for particular inputs or scenarios. BigO/omega and theta describe the upper, lower and tight bounds for the runtime.
            • Space Complexity Care about the amount of memory parallel to time complexity. • Drop the constants Big O describes the rate of increase , drop the constants in runtime . If you are going to count the number of instructions, then you'd have
            to go to the assembly level and take into account all other small options to optimize something . • Drop the non-dominant terms. • Multi-part Algorithms: When do you multiply and when do you add them. • If your algorithm is in : • Do this,
            then, when you're done, do that: add the runtimes • Do this for each tie you do that: multiply the runtimes. .
